Seasons

01 Seasons
01_01	Seasons is a mod that improves realism in the Farming Simulator game by adjusting nearly all aspects  to more realistic parameters. Everything from seasonal effects to crop growth patterns to animal production has been changed to a more realistic level.
01_02	The game year has been broken up into 4 seasons: spring, summer, autumn and winter. Each season is broken into 3 parts: early, mid and late. These parts are referred to as transitions.
01_03	Your activities are tied to the time of year they take place in real life.

02 Seasonal Effects (1)
02_01	Weather is random from day to day, but follows a pattern from season to season.
02_02	Spring will be rainy and foggy with some chances of sunny weather. Summer will be warmer and drier. Hail storms can occur without any warning. Autumn will be rainy with some sunny weather. Winter will be rainy, but often cold enough to allow snow to fall, maybe even stay on the ground.
02_03	Snow will fill tippers and shovels, unless the tipper or shovel is covered in a shed with a snow mask or a tarp. Snow will also reduce traction, thus making vehicles slower.

03 Seasonal Effects (2)
03_01	Daylight hours are also affected with the seasons. Winters have shorter days (8 hours) while summers have longer days (17 hours).
03_02	Bunker silos and silage bales require time to ferment. It takes one third of a seasons (1 transition) to fully ferment either a bunker silo or a silage bale.
03_03	Seasons will also affect trees and foliage. The trees will change state according to seasonal temperature changes. Leaves will turn color and drop in the autumn. Trees will go bare in winter and will be lighter green in the spring.
03_04	(note: maybe add a picture of foliage in spring, summer, fall and winter)

04 Weather Forecast
04_01	The weather forecast has been reintroduced with Seasons and can activated by Left Alt + F. (note: maybe add a picture of the forecast here)
04_02	The weather forecast shows the high/low temperatures and the weather (sunny, foggy, rainy, snowy, cloudy) for the next 7 days. Hailstorms will not appear on the weather forecast, as hail in real life is often an unexpected event.
04_03	The number on the right of each forecast block represents the day of the season.

05 Soil
05_01	Soil temperature is modeled using thermodynamic equations and historical data. This means the soil will freeze in the winter when the air temperature drops below a certain point for a certain length of time. The soil will then thaw in the spring when the air temperature rises above a certain threshold for a certain of length of time.
05_02	The soil cannot be worked when the ground is frozen. Crops will not grow in frozen soil.
05_03	Crops will only germinate when the soil temperature is above their germination temperatures. The germinations temperatures are included on the first page of the Seasons Mod settings menu (Left Alt + S).

06 Crops - Intro (1)
06_01	When starting a new game all crops will be reset to their harvested stages to simulate the fact the fields have not been worked since the autumn. When using the Seasons mod for the first time in an existing save game you will have the option to either reset the crops or not.
06_02	The default growth patterns of crops have been replaced with the Seasons Mod. Crops will now follow a realistic growth pattern following their corresponding seasonal planting and harvesting times. This also means that the winter will kill most crops and crops planted at the wrong time will not grow.

07 Crops - Intro (2)
07_01	Crops are only harvestable in their final growth stage, except for poplar, oilseed radish, potatoes and sugar beets and will stay in this final stage until they are killed off in the winter.
07_02	Silage from whole-crop or corn can still be harvested in its final green state.

08 Crops - Arable Crops
08_01	Crop growth is now much longer. It may take a half a year for a crop to reach the harvestable stage.
08_02	Winter will kill most crops, but winter and spring crops are possible. Wheat, barley, poplar, grass, oilseed radishes and canola can be planted in the autumn for winter crops or planted in the spring for spring crops. Be certain that the soil is warm enough for the germination of these crops.
08_03	Corn, soybeans, sunflower, sugar beets and potatoes must be planted in the spring. Be sure to check the growth overview in the Seasons menu because some crops cannot be planted in the first transition of spring (early spring) and will die, even if the soil temperature is above germination temperature.

09 Crops - Hay, Straw and Grass
09_01	In winter grass is reset to its harvested stage to simulate the winter killing off the grass when it becomes cold.
09_02	Grass bales need to be used or wrapped for silage within 2 days of baling. After 2 days the grass will rot and the bale will disappear.
09_03	Swaths of hay, grass and straw will begin to reduce in size, and will eventually disappear after several days. Grass swaths are reduced at midnight every day. Hay and straw swath are reduced after every growth stage as well as after being exposed to rain.
09_04	Straw and hay must be baled before it can be sold - loose straw and hay cannot be sold as their price is 0. Grass, baled or loose, cannot be sold, as their price is also 0. Wrap the grass bales before selling them.

10 Crops - Trees
10_01	Trees take more time to reach their fully grown state. It will take plantable trees 5 game years to be fully grown and after 2 years they can be cut.
09_02	Trees inhibit the growth of other trees if they have been planted too close together. To restart the growth of the tree you will need to thin out the trees.

11 Crops - Weather Effects
11_01	Rain, hail and snow affect the moisture levels of the crops. If the moisture in the crops is above certain point because of bad weather, you will not be able to harvest your crops. Moist summer nights can occur without warning.
11_02	After the rain your crops will need time to dry out, which is dependent upon the air temperature and the time of year. Warmer weather means crops will dry out faster than in cooler weather.
11_03	Using a tedder on hay while crops are wet will produce wet grass. Be certain to only use a tedder when the crops are dry enough.
11_04	On a mod map that has been prepared with a snow mask by the modder hay and straw bales that have been exposed to the rain or snow will begin to rot, unless the bales are stored in a shed with a snow mask. Bad weather will not affect wrapped bales or bales on a map without a snow mask.

12 Maintenance
12_01	Your tractors and harvesters require periodic maintenance in order to keep them operational. The maintenance period is every 30 hours or half a year, whichever comes first. Vehicles that are past due their maintenance may take longer to start.
12_02	You can repair your vehicles either at the vehicle shop or the placeable repair shop. Note that it will be more expensive to repair at the vehicle shop.
12_03	The age of your vehicle is the days since your last repair.
12_04	Only drivable vehicles will require periodic maintenance. Tools and implements will be automatically repaired as needed.

13 Economy
13_01	The loan cap has been changed from 200,000 to 30% of your owned land and placeable building values. The minimum loan cap is 300,000 and the maximum loan cap is 1,000,000.
13_02	Income from missions have been reduced. You will earn roughly 5 times more than a hired worker working on the same field.
13_03	Maintenance of all vehicles (in addition to the periodic maintenance) includes maintenance and taxes relative to how much it is being used. Clean machines will also reduce maintenance costs. Machines that are not used will also have their maintenance costs reduced.
13_04	Crop prices fluctuate with the changes in the seasons in a more realistic manner.

14 Hired Help
14_01	Hired workers require overtime pay. If a hired worker is used before 6AM and after 6PM, or on the weekends, his/her pay will be 50% higher.

15 Animals - Intro
15_01	Animal production has been adjusted with Seasons to more realistic parameters. All animals will consume more water in the summer than in the winter. Cows and pigs will require more straw in the winter. The max feeding capacities have been reduced from 6 days to 3 days.
15_02	Animals only give offspring at a certain time of the year. Pigs and sheep will produce offspring in the spring, while cows will produce offspring in the summer.
15_03	Animals will die if they do not have food or water. This is disabled on Easy difficulty.
15_04	Grass cannot be fed in the winter. You should use hay instead.

16 Animals - Production
16_01	Milk and wool production is dependent upon the season.
16_02	Wool is only produced in the spring.
16_03	Milk is produced year round, but is increased in the winter and the spring. While grass cannot be fed in the winter, this would normally reduce the cows productivity to at most 80%. However, Seasons increases milk production in the winter and spring to make up for the lack of grass in these months.

17 Seasons Menu
17_01	The Seasons Menu is used as a reference guide for planting and to change settings related to the Seasons. This menu is activated by Left Alt + S.
17_02	The first page is your guide to planting and harvesting windows. The germination temperatures of all crops are shown on the left of the graph. If the temperature next to a crop is white, it means it is warm enough to plant that particular crop. If the temperature is blue, it is too cold.
17_03	The second page is the settings menu. Here the season length (3/6/9/12 day seasons), season notifications (on/off), snow mode (on/off/1-layer, tracks on/off), crop moisture (on/off) and temperature settings (C/F) can all be changed.

18 HUD
18_01	A HUD to the left of the clock in the upper left corner displays information relevant to Seasons. It shows the current air temperature on top and ground temperature on bottom. The state of the ground (wetcrops/frozen ground) is also displayed to the left of this HUD.
18_02	Directly below the clock is where the seasonal period and day of the current season is displayed.
18_03	When activated, the forecast HUD will appear below the clock in the upper left corner.
18_04	When the help menu is activated (F1) the maintenance timer is displayed near the bottom. This is only displayed when you are in a vehicle.

19 Miscellaneous
19_01	If you do not wish to work during the night, you have the option to skip to the morning. After the night falls and you are on foot you can press Left Alt + N to skip to the morning.
19_02	If you decide to change the season length in the middle of an existing save game, it is recommended that you 1) change the season length during the winter to reduce undesired effects on existing crops and 2) restart the game/server after changing the season length.
19_03	While it is your game to play as you want, it is suggested as a challenge to only play with a 9-day season and at 5x time acceleration. This way you spend the spring only cultivating and planting crops, tending to crops and cutting hay in the summer, harvesting and plowing in the fall, and tending to the animals, machines, forests, and selling crops during the winter.
